# hello-world
Hello everyone, my name is Senpai-Github. Some of my hobbies are: gaming, programmin, and learning. Some things that I like to do the most is Learn, the reason why is because there is never too much school. School has taught me so many valuable lessons for life, and I am not going to stop going to school until I feel that I know more that the average human.
